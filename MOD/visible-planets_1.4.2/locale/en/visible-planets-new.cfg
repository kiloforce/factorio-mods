[mod-setting-description]
visible-planets-regen-renders=Works in game only! Enable this to remove all planet renders, allowing them to be regenerated with new settings. This is only needed to update platforms that can't move; Automated ones will update themselves on departure. (This setting will auto-disable afterwards.)
visible-planets-planet-pos-x=Resting position for the rendered planet. Negative values will move planet to the left.
visible-planets-planet-pos-y=Resting position for the rendered planet. Negative values will move planet north/up.
visible-planets-planet-init-dist=Initial distance of planet when arriving. Planet will spawn this distance above it's resting position, and move down to rest. Departure distance is simply twice this value.
visible-planets-planet-init-scale=Initial scale of the planet when spawning/despawning, default 0 to hide creation and deletion. Capped to final scale, at which point the planet will effectively not scale during animations.
visible-planets-planet-scale=Resting scale for the rendered planet. Large values will result in a pixelated planet, though the default is already at 6x. You can lower this for a smaller but nicer looking planet.
visible-planets-planet-anim-dur=Duration in ticks for the planet's animation. Lower values will make the planet move faster. (60 ticks = 1 second)
visible-planets-planet-angle=Planet sprite will be rotated clockwise by this amount in degrees. Must be between 0 and 359. You probably want to turn off planet rotation if using this.
visible-planets-enable-parallax=Enable parallax effect for rendered planets. This will make the planet move slightly when you look around for added depth, though will behave weirdly when two players are looking at the same planet.
visible-planets-parallax-factor=Parallax effect strength. Higher values will make the planet move less, lower values will make it move more. Minimum of 0.1.
visible-planets-enable-rotation=Enable rotation for rendered planets. This will make the planet rotate around it's center. Looks just a little weird.
visible-planets-rotation-speed=Rotation speed for the planet in degrees per tick. Higher values will make the planet rotate clockwise faster. Must be between -180 and 180. (Though 180 is WAY too fast, default is 0.01)
visible-planets-override-show-planets=Other mods are able to disable certain locations from being rendered, like asteroid belts. Enable this to force all locations to be rendered, assuming it has a sprite it can render.
visible-planets-planetslib-compat=When enabled, moons added by mods will show their parent body behind themself, and planets with moons will show their moons in a similar fashion. (Must be a PlanetsLib moon to work.)
visible-planets-planetslib-scale=Scale of bodies rendered by PlanetLib compat, relative to parent body.
visible-planets-planetslib-x=X position of first background render. Planets with multiple moons will generate additional renders relative to this position.
visible-planets-planetslib-y=Y position of first background render. Planets with multiple moons will generate additional renders relative to this position.
visible-planets-planetslib-tint=Lower values will make background renders darker. A value of 1 will render them normally.
