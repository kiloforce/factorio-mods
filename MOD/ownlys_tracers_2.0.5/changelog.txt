Version: 2.0.4
Date: 2024-12-14
  Changes:
    - Now using a graphic based on the railgun projectile
    - The projectile animation, the scale and the bullet speed needed to be carefully matched. I can not recommend changing the corresponding settings
    - Since the projectile graphic is based on a space age asset, i had to add space age as a requirement
