[mod-setting-description]
ownlys_tracers--range=this will also limit the range of all your ammo turrets to this value +2\nIGNORED WHEN MISFIRES IS DISABLED
ownlys_tracers--misfires=when using this, the bullet range will have an effect.\nalso you won't be able to attack your own tructures anymore
ownlys_tracers--collision_scale=Hitbox of the bullets
ownlys_tracers--directional_targeting=Requires misfires to be enabled!\nplay the game like a twinstick shooter
ownlys_tracers--player_lead_target=When using misfires, this allows you to hit enemies that move diagonal to you.\nunfortunately this introduces a bug making your character ignore the max range
ownlys_tracers--magazine_size=When using misfires, or even worse: directional targeting, i suggest you set this to 15-20.\nI increased the magazines by 10% because turrets might keep firing at an enemy while the killing bullet is already on it's way.\n10=mod won't touch anything
ownlys_tracers--mech_armor=slightly shifts the your character's projectile creation center up, so it looks a bit less weird with the mech armor
